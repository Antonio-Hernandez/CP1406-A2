                        <p>Domenico is one of Brisbane’s most experienced and versatile multicultural cabaret entertainers with the ability to perform an endless repertoire of world music including Jazz, Latin, Ballroom, Background, Rock &amp; Pop and others that are sure to please all.</p>

                        <p>Domenico commenced his musical career in 1971 at the age of 4. He studied music on the traditional European instrument called the Piano Accordion, gaining recognition amongst his peers as a specialist of his instrument.</p>

                        <p>In 1986, Domenico commenced performing with a three piece cabaret band at numerous private functions, clubs, hotels and events throughout south-east Queensland.</p>

                        <p>After working a residency for over 15 years, Domenico teamed up with his long time friends, Gianni, Jose, Juan, Adam &amp; Roberto to form a sophisticated 3-5 piece band known as The Latin Mafia performing swing &amp; Latin classics from the Rat Pack era.</p>

                        <p>Featuring a dynamic vocal ability and musical prowess on the Accordion that has been fused with the latest electronic MIDI technology, Domenico continues to perform both as the band leader and as a soloist for numerous private &amp; corporate engagements.</p>

                        <p>In 2009 Domenico was honoured to emcee the Queensland Multicultural Awards Presentation Ceremony at Queensland’s Parliament House and to then later entertain the numerous dignitaries, distinguished guests and winners in the Grand Hall with The Latin Mafia.</p>

                        <p>Later in the year, Domenico and The Latin Mafia performed at the closing ceremony of the 62nd ‘Coupe Mondiale’ World Accordion Championships held in Auckland New Zealand.</p>

                        <p>Domenico has performed at numerous festivals along the east coast of Australia along with performing at QPAC with the Queensland Pops Orchestra. In 2012, Domenico joined the popular 10 piece Celtic band, Murphy’s Pigs, featuring his talented skills on vocals and the piano accordion bring the band to a new dimension. In 2013, the band were runners up in Tamworth for the battle of the bands and were nominated in the Golden Fiddle awards.</p>

                        <p>With a core blend of world-wide cultures and tastes, Domenico can perform a diverse range of musical styles from all around the world including classical, sweet jazz from the 40-50’s, passionately romantic Italian &amp; Spanish classics, all of the Hot &amp; Spicy South American rhythms as well as the great pop and rock from all eras.</p>
