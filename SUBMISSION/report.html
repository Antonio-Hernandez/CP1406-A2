    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Combining skills and creative ideas to form a final result.
<br>
 Learning new skills for designing sites and solving problems while adding new content
 <br>
 Enjoyed keeping consistantly busy and being able to work consistantly, it was rewarding when things worked.
 
 ...</p>

<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Hard to get the group together to finish work...
<br> had trouble working through certain issues like the webswite adjusting when resized.
<br> had to make some compromises to design because lacked the skill to complete
</p>

<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> (including significant lessons) Learnt new skills trying to add features to the website, gaine a lot of insight into web development and what makes a good site.
<br> enjoyed how it kept me busy solving problems or trying to work out how to implement something. While it was frustrating when we couldnt get some things to work, completing a task was rewarding and felt like id gained new skills.
