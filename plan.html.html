        <h3>Goals</h3>

        <p>
        The aim of this website is to increase ticket sales for the orchestra, by making the layout of the website pages easy and clear to use.
        </p>


        <h3>Success Evaluation</h3>

        <p>
        The websites success should be evaluated on an increase in ticket numbers and donations. Based on these numbers the client will be able to reflect on data to make decisions on future shows, themes and reflect on target audience data for marketing purposes.<br>
        The website users should be able to easily find relevant information on the homepage. This can be achieved by placing the focus on upcoming shows using flyers with dates and pricing information clearly displayed alongside the flyer. The home site will also require a sign up and contact function that will allow musicians to join the orchestra or community members to make donations.

        </p>

        <h3>Target Audience</h3>

        <p>
        The focus of the website being on parents of musicians and the target audience (estimated age group) 50+ y.o who are genuinely interested in the orchestra and want learn more.<br>
        From a design perspective the client has requested “elegant spunk”. We believe there should be a balance between classical themes and use of colours associated with the Great Barrier Reef. 
        The orchestra has adopted a blue/green scarf in their outfit to express the colours of the reef and their pride in our local area. We have planned to sample the colour from their scarf to use as a main colour design choice throughout the website. 
        Other colours we have considered to inspire a vision to the user were the colours on stage: curtains, stage boards, instrument colours such as a maple or spruce wood colour from a cello, or a ebony marble colour of wind instruments or the ivory keys of a piano.
        Other design ideas we thought would be appealing was inspiration from old marquees and sign boards.
