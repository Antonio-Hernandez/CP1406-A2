				<div class="description-col col-3 col-m-6">
                    <p>Richard McIntyre sustains a long and distinguished career as bassoonist, music educator, conductor and arranger, and has focussed this considerable breadth and diversity on his work at the ANU School of Music for over a quarter of a century. One of Australia’s most respected and successful bassoon teachers at all levels, his teaching places great emphasis on the establishment of a close personal relationship with each one-to-one student, and on the development of a thorough understanding of the instrument and its techniques, the specifics of musical fabric and effect, and the various musical functions which the bassoon fulfils in varied styles and repertoires. This approach has yielded a remarkably high proportion of graduates who have established successful full-time careers as professional musicians both within Australia and overseas, as members of prominent orchestras, free-lancers, specialists in historically-informed performance on period instruments, instrumental teachers, and members of the armed services.</p>
